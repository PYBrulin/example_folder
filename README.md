# Example folder

This folder contains the scripts that will be used during the course: "GESTION_DE_DEVELOPPEMENT_DE_LOGICIELS_ET_GESTION_DE_VERSIONS".

Two implementations of the same algorithm will be given. One using Python, the other using Matlab.

The algorithm aims to represent a feedback thrust control of a 1DOF rocket, by manipulating the output thrust.
